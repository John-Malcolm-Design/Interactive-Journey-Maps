# Access Finland: Co-Design Workhop
**Personas & Journey Maps**

The repo contains an interactive website which was shared with workshop participants interested in developing an association for International Students at Aalto University. The workshop focused on solutions to improve the overall integration and job search experience of international students, to reduce inequality in this important area. 

The website works by showcasing personas and journey maps based on our user interviews. This website facilitates greater prepardness and deeper empathy with the design subject, which helped facilitate a more productive workshop.

## The Personas

Ishaan, Kaarina & Oliver are the three personas developed for the project. All three were illustrated using Adobe Illustrator. You can access the Illustrator file in [Creative Cloud here](https://assets.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:EU:7cb1e597-e358-47da-9404-c1128bc0198e?view=difile)

## Running & Building the Site

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
